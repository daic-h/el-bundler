# trindle.el #

'trindle.el' referred to "bundler" of programming language ruby, and created it.
Unlike package management, only the function of simple management is offered.
These manage that in which I have installed what from init.el(or any config file).

## TODO: ##

* Write a README, Sample Code, and Useage.
* Refactoring of duplication function.
